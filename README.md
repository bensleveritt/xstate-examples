# XState Examples

These are some examples of using XState to model state machines in TypeScript/JavaScript.

I often find myself wanting to use XState when defining UI and business logic, but it can be harder sell to developers who are not familiar with state machines.

I think that state machines are a powerful tool for modeling complex systems and can help improve the maintainability and scalability of your code.

This is also an opportunity for me to learn more about testing machines, such as model-based testing and property-based testing.
